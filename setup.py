"""
Flask Boilerplate
-----------------

This extension is in fact an evergrowing collection of boilerplate code applicable
to many web-apps. The modules range from things as simple as view helpers to things
like pre-baked models for common applications (like users or credit cards) pre-configured
for SQLAlchemy.

The extension is well-organized to faciliate the the piecemeal selection and there is little
to no coupling between modules or even functions / classes within.

Obviously a great deal of this code is taken from repeated best-practice code used in numerous
domain specific projects and so the mission to abstract ever further is always assumed.
That said-- ideally code does not make it into this boilerplate extension unless it is
sufficiently abstract to begin with.
